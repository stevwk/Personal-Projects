Welcome to my personal projects repo! This repository is where I keep track of all of my completed and in progress projects. It's a way for me to keep everything organized and in one place rather than scattered across multiple folders on my desktop and across devices.

Regardless of the organization, it is also an archive to show the creative process. Every project here is a concept that I have wanted to explore and bring to life for others to use as well. These are not groundbreaking ideas, and may not lead to anything worth in terms of value - but, every idea has the potential to lead to something very unique.

So I invite you to look at what I have been working on in my spare time! Think of them as puzzles that have been solved and puzzles to be completed! 

Thank you kindly for visiting this repository, I hope you find value within my works and if there is any feedback, I am always open to it.
